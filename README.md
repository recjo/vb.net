# vb.net
Prior to becoming a C# programmer, I was a full-time vb.net programmer. Here is a small sample of some projects I developed.

* [Job Listings](/JobListings) - This application added job listings to any vb.net website just by publishing the directory to the web server. Features a back-end administation section to easily add/delete job listings in a SQL Server database. Jobs can eb saearched and displayed in a list. Allows users to submit job application to any job listing. DDL sql script creates necessary tables.

* [Database-driven Website](/hs-football) - Complete dynamic website for a high school football team. Features back-end admin section for content management. I also created the SQL Server database tables. (the original web design was done by a graphic designer, not me)
